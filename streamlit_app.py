# Summary:
#adventure movies were able to make the most money while documentary or horror movies were the least succsesfull for disney and most genre's have somewhat consitant earnings the most inconsistent sees to be action movies with only 3 movies that had high total grossing

# hypothesis: 2
#Code:
data_disney = df[(df["release_date"] >= "2000-01-01")
                 & (df['release_date'] <= "2010-12-31")]

             y="total_gross",

fig.show()

#Summary:
st.write('I found that Toy Story 3, Finding Nemo, Pirates of the Carribean: Dead Man's Chest, and Alice in Wonderland were the most popular movies. The other movies reached a gross of under 300 million dollars.')

# hypothosis: 3
# code here:
df['release_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['release_date'])
fig2 = px.scatter(df, x="release_date", y="total_gross", color="movie_title")
fig2.show()

# summery: As shown in the produced scatter plot, the type of correlation between total gross and release_date is weak positive. You can see that as modern disney movies grossed higher on average than past disney movies. However, that may be due to the fact that disney has released more frequently in the modern era.

# hypothosis: 4

# Code:

df['release_decade'] = (df['release_date'].dt.year // 10) * 10
decade_counts = df['release_decade'].value_counts().sort_index()
fig = px.bar(x=decade_counts.index,

             template='plotly_white')
fig.show()

#Summary:
# I found that the 1990s released the most Disney movies, followed by the 2000s. This surprised me as I would have thought the most recent decade would have released the most disney movies. I would assume 2010 to 2020 would have released the most movies if the data was not cut off at 2016. The 1930s have the least amount of movies produced. This makes sense considering the company released their first movie in 1937, leaving the decade only 3 years to make more.

# hypothosis: 5
# Code:
st.subheader("Hypothesis 5: Is there a correlation between decade and genre popularity?")
compare_disney = df.groupby('genre')['release_decade'].value_counts().reset_index(name='count')
fig2 = px.scatter(compare_disney, x="release_decade", y="count", color="genre")
fig2.show()
# Summary:
# I found that the popularity of genres changed each decade. Comedy was very popular in the 80s all the way to the 00s but then adventure tops the 2010s. The genre popularity also depended on the amount of movies release that decade. Overall Comdey, Drama, Adventure and Action found themselves with more movies produced then other genres.

# hypothosis: 6
st.subheader("Hypothesis 6: What month was most popular to release movies?")
df["release_date"] = pd.to_datetime(df["release_date"])
df["month"] = df['release_date'].dt.month
month_df = df.groupby("month")['total_gross'].mean().reset_index()
fig = px.line(month_df, x="month", y="total_gross")
fig.show()

#Summary:
# I found that the overall popularity of disney movies rises and falls in spikes throughout the year. May is the month that is most popular to release movies and September was the least. Overall the summer and winter months seem to be the most popular season to release movies and the season in between not as much

# hypothosis: 7
#Code:

compare_disney = df.groupby('genre')['mpaa_rating'].value_counts().reset_index(
  name='count')
fig2 = px.bar(compare_disney, x="genre", y="count", color="mpaa_rating")
fig2.show()
#Summary
#I found that all Black Comedy movies are all rated R, and all of the Concert/Performance movies are rated G. The other categories each have multiple ratings, but some constant ratings are R, PG, and PG-13.
